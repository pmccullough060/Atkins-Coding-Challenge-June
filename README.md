# Atkins Coding Challenge June

##About
This is my attempt of the June coding challenge in Python, described as:

"I have based this monthâ€™s challenge around reading an output file. The file I have provided, WAJAC.LIS, is produced by WAJAC which is a program used by some of our offshore structures teams to calculate wave loading."

### Tasks
- Extract each of the detailed tables.
- Create a graph for seastate number 1 that shows forces in X,Y,Z against phase angle.
- Write the detailed tables for each seastate into a sheet in an excel workbook

#### Dependencies
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
