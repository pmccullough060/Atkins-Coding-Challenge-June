# Atkins Coding Challenge June

I have based this monthâ€™s challenge around reading an output file. The file I have provided, WAJAC.LIS, is produced by WAJAC which is a program used by some of our offshore structures teams to calculate wave loading.

### Advanced
- Extract each of the detailed tables.
- Create a graph for seastate number 1 that shows forces in X,Y,Z against phase angle.
- Write the detailed tables for each seastate into a sheet in an excel workbook
